1. Collecting Tech Stack.
 Backend: Python, FastAPI, SQLITE, ChromaDb
 Frontend: Yet to be determined.
 Extra: Twillio (for sending messsages to whatsapp), bitly (to shorten email links, so that user can open when he needs available at the end of message)

| Step 3 | LLM classifier returning structured JSON            |: Done (As a basic app, Python based classifier with key-words as LLM might cost/take time to implement)
| Step 4 | Priority-based notification logic working           |: Done (Only high priority are made to notify)
| Step 5 | Notification templates and rate limiting integrated |: Done
| Step 6 | LLM Integration for better classification           |: Done
| Step 7 | Implemented priority-based (High, Low)              |: Done
| Step 8 | Front-end Integration and testing                   |
| Step 8 | End-to-end deployment and testing                   |
| step 9 | Smart replies, (user can reply via whatsapp,        |
|        |                         it goes and sends to sender)|
